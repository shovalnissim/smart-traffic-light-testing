# Smart Traffic Light

# Assignment Description
The smart traffic light

The purpose of the smart traffic light is to divide the green light time based on the amount of traffic at
the intersection.
There are two roads at our junction, and they intersect:

* North to South
* East to west

Statistics:
* Every 10 to 30 seconds, cars arrive along each road.
* It takes each car 2 seconds to cross the junction when the green light is on

Your mission is to create a UI that simulates the junction, display the amount of cars in each road and
reduces traffic jams. Build the simulation based on components and services using one of the JS
frameworks (preferred Angular) or Vanilla JS.
